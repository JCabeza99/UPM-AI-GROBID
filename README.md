# UPM-AI-GROBID

UPM-AI-GROBID is a project dedicated to the creation of a simple python client that makes calls to the Grobid API passing the papers found in the
input folder and renders a report with a wordcloud and the links found in each paper. Aditionally a graph with the number of figures per article is
generated at the end of the report.

For the installation and requirements please check the [Step by step guide](https://upm-ai-grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execution.html)
